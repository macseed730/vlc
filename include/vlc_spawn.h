 * Spawn a child process.
 *
 * This function creates a child process. The created process will run with the
 * same environment and privileges as the calling process.
 *
 * An array of file descriptors must be provided for the child process:
 * - fdv[0] is the standard input (or -1 for nul input),
 * - fdv[1] is the standard output (or -1 for nul output),
 * - fdv[2] is the standard error (or -1 to ignore).
 * The array must have at least 4 elements and be terminated by -1.
 * Some platforms will ignore file descriptors other than the three standard
 * ones, so those should not be used in code intended to be portable.
 *
 * vlc_waitpid() must be called to collect outstanding system resources
 * after the child process terminates.
