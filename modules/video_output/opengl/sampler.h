/**
 * The purpose of a sampler is to provide pixel values of a VLC input picture,
 * stored in any format.
 *
 * Concretely, a GLSL function:
 *
 *     vec4 vlc_texture(vec2 coords)
 *
 * returns the RGBA values for the given coordinates.
 *
 * Contrary to the standard GLSL function:
 *
 *     vec4 texture2D(sampler2D sampler, vec2 coords)
 *
 * it does not take a sampler2D as parameter. The role of the sampler is to
 * abstract the input picture from the renderer, so the input picture is
 * implicitly available.

     * It is stored as an array of 6 floats:
     *
     *     [a, d, b, e, c, f]

     * To compute texture coordinates, left-multiply the picture coordinates
