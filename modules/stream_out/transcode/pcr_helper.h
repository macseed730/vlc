/**
 * The transcode PCR helper is a wrapper of the pcr_sync helper specific for processing
 * units that have a high risk of altering the frames timestamps or simply dropping them. The usual
 * case is an encoder and/or a filter chain which is exactly what transcode does.
 *
 * This helper uses an approximation of the max frame `delay` taken by the processing unit. When
 * this delay is bypassed, it is assumed that a frame was dropped and eventually a new PCR can be
 * synthetised and forwarded to keep the stream going.
