Small Hacking file for the Qt Interface

If you ever code for Qt interface, please read this before.

** Code Conventions **

Please respect VLC code conventions here:
 - NO trailing spaces
 - NO tab
 - Indentation is 4 spaces
 - Braces ARE indented
 - Space before and after operators
 - Case labels are on the same column as the switch

Refer to http://wiki.videolan.org/Code_Conventions it should be up to date

** Include order **

- VLC include/*.h includes
- Other VLC .h includes (gruiking :D)
- Qt module includes
- Qt includes

** Naming **
This naming is stupid and inconsistent :D

Try to prefix with psz_, i_, b_, ui_ for the normal basic C/C++ styles.

If you have spare time, prefix QString with qs_.

Use aPointerName over a_pointer_name for long names.

** QVLCFrame vs QVLCDialog **

A QVLCFrame is just a QWidget, without any parent and used as a Qt::Windows
A QVLCDialog is a QDialog.

This mean that the QVLCDialog is centered on the parent and ABOVE it, will be destroyed by the parent automatically.
This also mean that you have to destroy the QVLCFrame and to save its position/size.

So if your dialog is a dialog you are used to keep during a playing of a video, then use a QVLCFrame, else use a QVLCDialog, if this is something you do over anything else.

QVLCFrame: extended panel, messages...
QVLCDialog: preferences, open...

** virtual vs override **
Only mark functions with the virtual keyword if this is the initial virtual
declaration. Functions that override a virtual function should have the
override identifier appended. Not only is this a visual indicator to distinguish
virtual declarations from overriding implementations, it will also include a
compile-time check to ensure that the function actually overrides another
virtual function, with matching name and signature.

** HIG for Qt **
We tend to use GNOME/KDE specs over Vista ones for capitalizations:
We use Header for:
 - Menu
 - Menu items
 - GroupBox Titles
 - Windows and dialog Titles
We use Sentence for:
 - CheckBoxes
 - ComboBox list
 - ComboBox labels
 - Tooltips

We use "..." after a menu item if it opens another dialog.
