/**
 * @brief The ItemKeyEventFilter class allows to register an event filter,
 * which forwards the filtered key events to itself. This might be useful to
 * process key press before they are processed (and eventually accepted) by
 * children components
 *
 * this is usable as
 *
 *  EventFilter {
 *      filterEnabled: true
 *      Keys.onPressed: {
 *          //do stuff
 *          event.accepted = true //to block the event
 *      }
 *  }
 *
 *  Component.onCompleted: {
 *      filter.source = rootWindow
 *  }
 *
