/**
 * This class helps executing a processing on a `QThreadPool` and retrieve the
 * result on the main thread.
 *
 * It allows to properly handle the case where the receiver of the result is
 * destroyed while a processing is still running, without blocking (provided
 * that the `QThreadPool` is not destroyed).
 *
 * Here is how to use it properly.
 *
 * First, write a class inheriting `AsyncTask<T>` (`T` being the type of the
 * result), and implement the `execute()` method:
 *
 * \code{.cpp}
 *     struct MyTask : public AsyncTask<int>
 *     {
 *         int m_num;
 *
 *         MyTask(int num) : m_num(num) {}
 *
 *         int execute() override
 *         {
 *             // This will be executed from a separate thread
 *             sleep(1); // long-running task
 *             return m_num * 2;
 *         }
 *     };
 * \endcode
 *
 * To execute a new task asynchronously, instantiate it, connect the result
 * signal and start it:
 *
 * \code{.cpp}
 *     // To be called from the main thread
 *     void SomeQObject::asyncLoad(int num)
 *     {
 *         // Create a task and keep a reference in a field
 *         m_task = new MyTask(num);
 *
 *         // Connect the signal to be notified of the result
 *         connect(m_task, &BaseAsyncTask::result,
 *                 this, &SomeQObject::onResult);
 *
 *         // Submit the task to some thread pool
 *         m_start->start(m_threadPool);
 *     }
 * \endcode
 *
 * The task might be canceled at any time (it might continue running
 * asynchronously if it is already running, but the caller will not receive the
 * result):
 *
 * \code{.cpp}
 *     // To be called from the main thread
 *     void SomeQObject::cancelCurrentTask()
 *     {
 *         if (m_task)
 *         {
 *             m_task->abandon();
 *             m_task = nullptr;
 *         }
 *     }
 * \endcode
 *
 * The result slot must retrieve the result and _abandon_ the task:
 *
 * \code{.cpp}
 *     // Called on the main thread
 *     void SomeQObject::onResult()
 *     {
 *         // Retrieve the task instance from the slot, if necessary
 *         MyTask *task = static_cast<MyTask *>(sender());
 *
 *         // In basic cases (one task at a time), it should be the same:
 *         assert(task == m_task);
 *
 *         // Retrieve the result (can only be called once)
 *         int result = task->takeResult();
 *
 *         qDebug() << "The result of MyTask(" << task->m_num << ") is"
 *                  << result;
 *
 *         // Abandon the task (so that it can be destroyed)
 *         task->abandon();
 *         m_task = nullptr;
 *     }
 * \endcode
 *
 * The `abandon()` method allows to handle both cancelation and memory
 * management. A task is semantically owned by 2 components:
 *  - the caller
 *  - the QThreadPool
 *
 * Indeed, the caller must be able to _cancel_ it without race conditions, even
 * if the task run() has completed. Conversely, the task must not be destroyed
 * unilaterally by the caller, to avoid crashing if it is currently running.
 *
 * The running state is tracked internally, and `abandon()` allows the caller
 * to declare that it won't use it anymore (and don't want the result). When
 * both conditions are met, the task is deleted via `QObject::deleteLater()`.
 *
 * For convenience, a `TaskHandle` smart pointer is provided to call
 * `abandon()` using RAII.
 *
 * The task result is provided via a separate method `takeResult()` instead of
 * a slot parameter, because otherwise, Qt would require its type to be:
 *  - non-template (like `std::vector<T>`),
 *  - registered to the Qt type system (wrapped into a `QVariant`),
 *  - copiable (not movable-only, like `std::unique_ptr<T>`).
