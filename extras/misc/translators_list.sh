# The simpler to handle git commiter check script gives better names and dates, but of course not for all contributors. However, cross checking is recommended.

# The idea is to use a diff next time, but I did not work out yet what files would be best for that. Probably after finding the doubles would be a good time to remove everything visible in older versions.
