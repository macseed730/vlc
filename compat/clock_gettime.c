/**
 * Get the monotonic time (CLOCK_MONOTONIC)
 * 
 * Calculates a monotically incrasing time since system boot
 * that continues to increment when the system is asleep.
 * 
 * Warnings to everyone trying to simplify this:
 * - Using mach_continuous_time is not equivalent to this, see
 *   the darwin manpage about CLOCK_MONOTONIC_RAW for an explanation.
 * - Using mach_absolute_time is not equivalent to this, as it does
 *   not continue to increment when the system is asleep.
 * - The boot time is queried twice in a loop and only used if both
 *   match. This is done to detect if the boot time change since we
 *   obtained the current time of day, as the boot time can change
 *   when the system wallclock is adjusted, as that will adjust the
 *   boot time accordingly.
